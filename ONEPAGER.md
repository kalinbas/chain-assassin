# Chain Assassin One-Pager

**Hunt or be hunted. On-chain.**

## What It Is

Chain Assassin is an open-source real-world elimination game with crypto-native prizes across Base today, with Arbitrum support planned.  
Players join location-based matches, and once a game is funded and started, progression and settlement run by deterministic rules with no live moderator.

## How a Match Works

1. Players register with a wallet and join a scheduled game.
2. Players check in at the meeting area and enter the live phase.
3. Targets are assigned and players hunt while staying inside a shrinking zone.
4. Winners and rewards are settled transparently, with refund paths for cancelled games.

## Why It Stands Out

- **Autonomous lifecycle**: funded matches run by rules, not organizer discretion.
- **Open source**: stack and logic are publicly auditable.
- **Real-time UX**: mobile gameplay + live spectator web experience.
- **Transparent rewards**: prize and refund flows are verifiable on-chain.

## Product Surfaces

- **Android app**: wallet operations, registration, check-in, and gameplay actions.
- **Website**: game discovery, live spectating, and lightweight account/game management.
